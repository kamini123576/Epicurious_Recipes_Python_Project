# Epicurious_Recipes_Python_Project
In this dataset I am analyzing a recipe dataset to understand the nutritional content (such as calories, sodium, fat, and protein) and how it varies across different recipes. However, the dataset contains missing values in key columns like calories, protein, fat, and sodium, which may hinder accurate analysis and insights.
My approach is focusing on the calories, sodium, fat, and dessert columns to explore the nutritional content of various recipes. The dataset has missing values in several key columns like calories, protein, fat, and sodium, which could skew the analysis if not handled properly.
Analysis:
Nutritional Distribution:

The majority of recipes have low to moderate levels of calories, fat, and sodium, but there are significant outliers in all three categories.
Most recipes are well-rated, with a skew towards higher ratings (above 3.75).
Recipe Trends by Year:

A massive spike in recipe additions occurred in 2005, followed by a significant decline and stabilization from 2006 onwards.
Dietary Focus:

Most recipes cater to healthy, low calorie, and low fat diets.
Fewer recipes target specific diets like low sodium and low sugar, despite growing health concerns around these areas.
Dessert Recipes:

A smaller portion of the dataset consists of desserts, and these typically show higher fat and calorie content.
Recommendations :
Handle Outliers:

Consider capping extreme outliers in calorie, fat, and sodium content to avoid skewing analysis and to provide a clearer picture of the average recipe's nutritional value.
Expand Specific Diets:

Increase the number of recipes catering to low sodium and low/no sugar diets to appeal to users with dietary restrictions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes).
Focus on Highly Rated Recipes:

Promote and highlight recipes with ratings above 4.0 to enhance user satisfaction and engagement.
Investigate the 2005 Surge:

Look into the factors that led to the massive spike in recipe additions in 2005 to identify opportunities for future growth and engagement.
Conclusion Slide:
Healthy and Popular Recipes: The dataset is largely focused on healthy, low-calorie, and low-fat recipes that cater to general wellness, with high user satisfaction.
Opportunities for Growth: Expanding recipe categories for low sodium and low/no sugar diets presents a key opportunity to meet growing health-conscious trends.
Future Strategy: Capitalize on high-rated recipes for promotional purposes, while addressing the gaps in specific dietary needs to maintain a broad and engaged user base.
